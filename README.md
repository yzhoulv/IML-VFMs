This is the official repo of our paper IML-VFMs: Benchmarking Image Manipulation Localization with Vision Foundation Models.

## TODO

- [X]  **Submit paper to journal, after the paper is writing finished.**
- [X]  **Show more inference results and computational code, after the paper is submitted.**
- [ ]  **Show more details about the method in our paper, as soon as the paper is accepted.**
- [ ]  **Publish the inference code and model, after the paper is accepted.**
- [ ]  **Publish the training code, after the paper is accepted.**


▪**The manuscript has been submitted. Due to space limitations, we have uploaded the inference results for the cross-dataset models (DINO v2, ViT Large) to Google Drive ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VgrkY9w_4ZTnQx74qnpdtK2IZISWGCv/view?usp=sharing)) and, to facilitate access for users in China, we have also uploaded them to Baidu Netdisk ([here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rFIcp_QJ9-HwzUflZiEFVQ?pwd=vfms)).**

▪**The calculation code for the inference results: `cal_results.py`**
